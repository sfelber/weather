# weather
Simple Spring Boot application to get current weather in the city by using Open Weather API.

Before using it is necessary to set your API KEY for Open Weather API.

Just put the correct API key to the configuration property `weather.api.openweathermap.apikey` either in `application.properties` file or as -D parameter when you run the application.
